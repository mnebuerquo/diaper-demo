# Bio: Sherman Adelson

"Oooh! Something shiny!" From native Windows apps to industrial process control,
native mobile apps and websites, it's all totally fascinating. I want to learn
and try everything. There are too few hours in the day.

I love startups. I've never gotten rich from one, but it's amazing how much you
learn from running around on fire.

I currently work for Kroger Digital and enjoy the risks and rewards of
building a dynamic content framework for an extremely high traffic website. My
team is the best part. They're an amazing group of people, and we have a lot of
fun while solving some really hard problems together.

When I'm not at work, I have innumerable hobby projects. I spend most of my
time with my wife and our dog. Neither of them are particularly interested in
technology, but they listen while I tell them about it.
