# Diaper Your Children: Cleaning Up After Messy React Components

## Abstract

Putting React Components in diapers sounds pretty silly. What is this?

This is the story of a quest. It's a quest to build a robust error handling
solution for a high traffic website. It's an exploration of the edges of React.
It's a mission to protect component builders from themselves.

Basic understanding of React lifecycle methods is recommended for the audience,
but the challenges and journey will be presented in a way to be accessible for
anyone.

Come and join us for a humorous story of a team taking back their website from
unpredictable errors and malformed data.


## Key Takeaways

Error handling is like flossing. Everyone knows you need to do it, but not
everyone does it consistently. This talk is focused on error handling in React
with server-side rendering, so we'll talk about React, life-cycle methods, what
happens in server-side rendering, what is hydration, and more. Most importantly,
we'll talk about the value of thinking through your error handling strategy.
